# android-demo

This repository holds the source code of "Currency rates", a small Android demo app that fetches a list of currencies from an API and allows to check its value against other currencies. This demo was created by Tiago Martins, and aims to demonstrate a solid base structure and architecture for a project using some of the latest Android trends on a vertical project modularisation, using MVVM and kotlin coroutines.

Please note, that the project is focused on the code itself rather than the UI, so please expect a very basic UI.
